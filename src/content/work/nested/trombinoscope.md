## Introduction

> Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.

During my time at school, I collaborated with a fantastic team to revamp the school's directory, creating a more engaging and attractive version. The collaborative effort not only enhanced the visual appeal of the directory but also introduced me to a range of technical skills.

### Ideation

Our journey began with a comprehensive ideation phase, leveraging the Design Thinking methodology. This allowed us to deeply understand the user experience and envision a more user-friendly and visually appealing trombinoscope. Brainstorming sessions, user interviews, and feedback loops were integral parts of this phase, ensuring that our final product would address the specific needs of our school community.

### Code

The implementation of our vision involved a meticulous process of creating wireframes, designing mockups, and developing a functional prototype. The coding aspect was executed using HTML, CSS, and native PHP. This project served as my introduction to the world of web development, providing hands-on experience with fundamental concepts such as tables and loops.
