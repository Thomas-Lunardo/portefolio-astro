## Introduction

> Take your work seriously, not yourself.

In the spirit of holiday festivities, our team participated in a hackathon centered around the theme of year-end celebrations. Over the course of two intense days, we conceptualized and brought to life an application dedicated to the timeless tradition of Secret Santa. Aptly named Kitouchki, our project aimed to add a touch of excitement and mystery to the gift-giving season.

### Rapid Development

With a limited timeframe of just 48 hours, the challenge was not only to build a functional Secret Santa application but also to showcase our proficiency in various technologies. The project required a blend of creativity, efficiency, and technical prowess to deliver a polished product within the tight deadline.

### Technological Foundations

Our knowledge in the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern served as the cornerstone of our development approach. This framework facilitated a systematic organization of code, ensuring a clean and maintainable codebase. Leveraging MySQL, we implemented robust data creation and manipulation processes, crucial for managing user accounts and gift exchanges seamlessly.

### Dynamic Templates with TWIG

To enhance the user interface and create dynamic views, we incorporated the TWIG templating engine. TWIG's flexibility allowed us to craft visually appealing and customizable templates, enriching the overall user experience. The integration of TWIG not only streamlined the development process but also provided a foundation for future scalability.

### Secure Authentication with Bcrypt

Recognizing the importance of user security, we implemented a robust authentication system using bcrypt. This cryptographic hash function ensured the protection of user credentials, adhering to best practices in safeguarding sensitive information. The inclusion of secure authentication added a layer of trust to our Secret Santa application, fostering a secure and enjoyable environment for users.

### Best Presentation Award

Our team proudly clinched the Best Presentation award from the jury, a testament to our effective communication and the standout features of Kitouchki during the hackathon. This acknowledgment added an extra layer of celebration to our festive project, underscoring our commitment to excellence.
